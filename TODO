Stuff that needs doing, in no particular order

* Functions
    - Simplex noise ✓
    - Loading images
        - depends on: Scene-global resources
    - Expressions
* Constructive solid geometry
    - Merges
    - Intersections ✓
    - Differences (clipping)
    - Other interesting constructions
        - Dilations (Minkowski addition), Erosions, Openings, Closings?
* BVH accelerator
    - depends on: Bounding boxes
* Bounding boxes
* Scene-global resources
    - i.e. Scene holds images, reusables, etc, with a lifetime. Other scene
      objects can hold references to these objects.
* Participating media
* Possibly a better medium infrastructure.
* Sky pigment
* More intersectables!
    - Cube
    - Triangle
    - Iso-surface
    - Height field
    - Swept sphere
    - Swept curve (lathe)
    - ...
* IsInside function on SolidIntersectable trait ✓
* Multi-threading optimization ✓
* Vectorization optimization ✓
* Scene loading
    - parse scene description
    - scene pre-processor
* Image post-processing
    - gamma correction
    - save as HDR
* Mesh loading
    - depends on: Triangles, BVH accelerator
* Scene serialization/deserialization
* Grid rendering
    - depends on: Scene serialization/deserialization
